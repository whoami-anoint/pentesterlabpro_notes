This challenge

In this challenge, your goal is to send a GET request to /pentesterlab

Recommandations

We recommend you to solve this challenge with curl initially. 
Then you can write a snippet of code in your favourite language to solve it 
(this will allow you to create a collection of scripts you can re-use in the future).
Writing your script

To write your script, you first need to learn about how to create a socket that will connect to the hostname provided. 
You then need to write to the socket. Once you have finished writing you can start reading the response from the socket.

Your request should look something like:

GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ptl-.....libcurl.so\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n

Make sure you use the right value for the
Host
header (the hostname of the lab). Otherwise you will be redirected to pentesterlab.com

The code relies on \r (cariage return or 0x0d) and new line \n (new line or 0x0a). 
The sequence \r\n is used to split each line and you shouldn't see it if you print the request.

For example, using echo:

	$ echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ptl-.....libcurl.so\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" 
	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: ptl-.....libcurl.so
	Connection: close
	 

But you can still see the sequence ( 0d 0a) if you use hexdump

$ echo -ne "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: ptl-.....libcurl.so\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" |hexdump -C

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-92e53ba0-f2d3a353.libcurl.so/. 

 Steps: 

 1) Visit the given link.
 2) In this challenge your goal is to send a GET request to /pentesterlab.
 3) Simply you can get the key with : http://ptl-92e53ba0-f2d3a353.libcurl.so/pentesterlab
    But in this lab recommends you to:
    curl http://ptl-92e53ba0-f2d3a353.libcurl.so/pentesterlab -vv

    It shows as:
    anoint@LAPTOP-IDSSEF88:~$ curl http://ptl-92e53ba0-f2d3a353.libcurl.so/pentesterlab -vv
