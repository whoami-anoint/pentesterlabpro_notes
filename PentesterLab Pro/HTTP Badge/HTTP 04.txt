This challenge

In this challenge, your goal is to send a GET request to /pentesterlab
with the Content-Type set to key/please

Content-Type is used by browsers to tell web applications in what format is used in the body of request.
Recommandations

We recommend you to solve this challenge with curl initially. Then you can write a snippet of code in your favourite language to solve it (this will allow you to create a collection of scripts you can re-use in the future).
Writing your script

To write your script, you can leverage your previous code and add the header Content-Type:

	 
	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: ptl-.....libcurl.so
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	Connection: close
