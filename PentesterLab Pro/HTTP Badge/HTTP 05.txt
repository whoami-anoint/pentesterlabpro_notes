PentesterLab: HTTP 05
1-2 minutes
This challenge

In this challenge, your goal is to send a GET request to /pentesterlab

with the Accept-Language set to key-please

Accept-Language is used by browsers to tell web applications what language user prefers.
Recommandations

We recommend you to solve this challenge with curl initially. Then you can write a snippet of code in your favourite language to solve it (this will allow you to create a collection of scripts you can re-use in the future).
Writing your script

To write your script, you can leverage your previous code and add the header Accept-Language:

	 
	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: ptl-.....libcurl.so
	Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
	Connection: close
