This challenge

In this challenge, your goal is to send a GET request to /pentesterlab
with the following cookie: key with the value please

Recommandations

We recommend you to solve this challenge with curl initially. 
Then you can write a snippet of code in your favourite language to solve it 
(this will allow you to create a collection of scripts you can re-use in the future).
Writing your script

To write your script, you can leverage your previous code and add the cookie. Cookies are transmitted in request as a header:

	 
	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: ptl-.....libcurl.so
	Cookie: name=value
	Connection: close

You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-e34d116d-c53b863a.libcurl.so/. 

Steps: 
1) Visit the given URL.

2) 
    anoint@LAPTOP-IDSSEF88:~$ curl 'http://ptl-e34d116d-c53b863a.libcurl.so/pentesterlab?key=please' -vv

Time to ask nicely
* Connection #0 to host ptl-e34d116d-c53b863a.libcurl.so left intact
anoint@LAPTOP-IDSSEF88:~$

So we have to: 
anoint@LAPTOP-IDSSEF88:~$ curl http://ptl-e34d116d-c53b863a.libcurl.so/pentesterlab -H 'Cookie: key=please'
