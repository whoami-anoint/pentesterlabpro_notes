Authentication 02 

This example is similar to the previous example. As soon as you receive a cookie from an application, it is always good to see what it looks like. Try to crack it using a password cracker or try to just Google it. From that you should be able to generate a valid cookie for the user admin.
 
 * If you get the same session ID many times when logging in: there is a problem! If you log in from a clean browser, you should never get the same cookies twice.
