 Authentication 01

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-db89ba42-dcc27620.libcurl.so/. 

 In this exercise, you can log in as user1. Your goal is to get logged in as admin. To do so, you need to carefully look at the response sent back by the server.

You can see that when you log in as user1, you get a cookie named user1. From that you can easily modify this value (using a proxy or a browser's extension) to get logged in as admin. 

Steps: 
1) Visit the given link: http://ptc-db89ba42-dcc27620.libcurl.so/. 

2) Register with admin but it don't worked. Then register with any of your username and password.  
(The objective of this exercise is to find a way to get logged in as the user "admin"...)

3) Open Web developer tools in the browser (Ctrl+shift+I) and go to the storage and session part. 

4) Change the value of your "username" with "admin" and reload the page.
5) Boom!! now  You are currently logged in as admin! The key for this exercise is 57af609c-9204-4a4f-aaac-058f169ea913
