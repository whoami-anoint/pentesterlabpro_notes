Authentication 03

This example shows the consequence of different method of string comparison. When you create a user, the application will check programmatically that the user does not exist by comparing the username provided with the existing user. When you log in, the application will check that your username and password are correct, and then it will save your username in your session. Finally, every time you will access the application, the application will retrieve your user's details based on the username provided in the session.

The trick here comes from the fact that the comparison when you create a user is done programmatically (i.e.: in Ruby) but when the user's details get retrieved, the comparison is done by the database. By default, MySQL (with the type VARCHAR) will perform a case insensitive comparison: "admin" and "Admin" are the same value.

Using that information, you should be able to create a user that will be identified as admin.

 Steps: 
 1) Visit the given link: http://ptc-db89ba42-dcc27620.libcurl.so/. 
 2) Register with admin but it don't worked. Then register with any of your username and password.  
    (The objective of this exercise is to find a way to get logged in as the user "admin"...)
 3) Open Web developer tools in the browser (Ctrl+shift+I) and go to the storage and session part. 
 4) Analize the value and try to convert a string to a MD5 hash. But lol it don't work always. So logout the session.
 5) Register with username: "aDmin" and your username. 
 6) Boom!! now you are currently logged in as admin! The key for this exercise is 8a51ff9d-03a9-40d2-9d8e-f8427a0fd6fc. 

Happy Hacking!! :)
