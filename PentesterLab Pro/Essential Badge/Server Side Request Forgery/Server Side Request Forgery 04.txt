Server Side Request Forgery 04

In this example, the developer blocked everything that doesn't match assets.pentesterlab.com. However, the regular expression seems a bit weak.

We setup a special DNS zone that will always answer 127.0.0.1 for any host in the domain hackingwithpentesterlab.link. That will probably help you.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-9124927f-9de119bd.libcurl.so/. 

    Steps: 
        1) Visit the given  URL: http://ptc-9124927f-9de119bd.libcurl.so/.
        2) Suddenly,we'll get redirected to: http://ptc-9124927f-9de119bd.libcurl.so/?url=https://assets.pentesterlab.com/hacker.txt.
        3) As we know that the developer blocked everything that doesn't match assets.pentesterlab.com. However, the regular expression seems a bit weak.

            We setup a special DNS zone that will always answer 127.0.0.1 for any host in the domain hackingwithpentesterlab.link.
        4) So it forms as: 
                http://ptc-9124927f-9de119bd.libcurl.so/?url=http://assets.pentesterlab.com.hackingwithpentesterlab.link:1234/hacker.txt
                Make a concept when we make '.' in any url it get redirected. LOl, it's small concept but I think to share it.
        5) Bravo!! We have solved this lab too. And the key is: 3dd4e035-8a1a-4cc2-a468-aff227106fe1!

        Happy Hacking!! :)
