Server Side Request Forgery 02

In this example, the developer blocked the previous attack by blocking 127.0.0.1. 
However, that's the only thing that is blocked. You should be able to find an alias for it.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-b18957c8-df7ed031.libcurl.so/. 

    Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-b18957c8-df7ed031.libcurl.so/. 
        2) Suddenly, we redirected to: http://ptc-b18957c8-df7ed031.libcurl.so/?url=https://assets.pentesterlab.com/hacker.txt
        3) As we know the developer blocked the previous attack by blocking 127.0.0.1. 
            So we can use 'localhost' instead of IP.
            It forms as: http://ptc-b18957c8-df7ed031.libcurl.so/?url=http://localhost:1234/hacker.txt
        4) Bravo!! We get the key: d87f4832-1601-4b41-91f5-401eb3adcf3b!

        Happy Hacking!! :)
