Server Side Request Forgery

A Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability allows an attacker to use a functionality of the web application to gain access to internal resources.
 Basically, we are going to get the server to make HTTP requests (or over protocols) on our behalf.

This can be used to access internal pages, perform network scans, trigger behaviours in different systems...

Here we will just try to retrieve the content of the webroot of a server listening on port TCP/1234.
 We can't access the service directly but we can get the vulnerable server to do it for us.
  To do so you will need to change the url parameter to access the local server on port TCP/1234. 

  
You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-3c164f11-f5f6b896.libcurl.so/. 

    Steps: 
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-3c164f11-f5f6b896.libcurl.so/. 
        2) Suddenly we'll get redirected to: http://ptc-3c164f11-f5f6b896.libcurl.so/?url=https://assets.pentesterlab.com/hacker.txt
            Retrieve the key located at the root of the webserver listening on localhost on port TCP/1234.
        3) We know the TCP IP with webserver is http://12.0.0.1. Replace this with https://assets.pentesterlab.com.
            See how it forms: http://ptc-3c164f11-f5f6b896.libcurl.so/?url=http://127.0.0.1:1234/hacker.txt
        4) Bravo!! Now we get the key: 6a5edda2-4b79-4fbc-a15b-292e4a2306fa!


    Happy Hacking!! :)
