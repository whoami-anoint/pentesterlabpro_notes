Open Redirect 01

This Challenge

Open Redirect vulnerabilities allows you to redirect the victim to a malicious website. They are low impact vulnerabilities in most cases unless you can use them to leak Oauth tokens.

In this challenge, you should be able to redirect the victim to a website you control (or webhook.site). Once the victim visit your page, you will get the key to score in the User-Agent. You can then submit the key.

Here it's an trivial openredirect, you can just put any URL to get the victim to your website.

This exercise gets scored in 2 steps. First, you need to get the victim to visit your page to get the key. Once you put the URL below and click submit, the victim will visit your link:

URL:

Note: The URL needs to start with the challenge's URL (for example: http://ptl-d6ec7b50-aeb96ff3.libcurl.so/redirect.php?...) 

Then you can use the form below to submit the key you retrieved from step 1:
To mark this exercise as completed, you need to submit the key that you will get by finishing this exercise:

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-d6ec7b50-aeb96ff3.libcurl.st/. 


 Steps: 
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-d6ec7b50-aeb96ff3.libcurl.st/.
    2) We can see 'click here' in that page. Copy the link address. 
        We might have notice about this lab that you should be able to redirect the victim to webhook.site
        Open the site and we can get url that have to be redirected.
    3) Now make the url format as:
         	ptl-9fa58ab6-85ba5199.libcurl.st/redirect.php?uri=https://webhook.site/7302b786-e834-4dc4-b64a-e00d1c9d6ea2
    4)  And back to the lab into and submit the url. Again visit previous site of webhook.site. 
    5) After some time we'll get our key in user-agent 	PTLAB_KEY: f7749e4c-8a79-4424-a027-7e8176792932 .
    6) Bravo!!  Congrats you have finished this exercise! 

            Happy Hacking!! :)
