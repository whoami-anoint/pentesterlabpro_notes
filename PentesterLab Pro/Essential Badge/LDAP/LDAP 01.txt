LDAP 01

In this first example, you connect to a LDAP server, using your username and password. 
In this instance, The LDAP server does not authenticate you, since your credentials are invalid.

However, some LDAP servers authorise NULL Bind: if null values are sent, the LDAP server will proceed to bind the connection, and the PHP code will think that the credentials are correct. 
To get the bind with 2 null values, you will need to completely remove this parameter from the query. 
If you keep something like username=&password= in the URL, these values will not work, since they won't be null; instead, they will be empty. 

*  This is an important check to perform on all login forms that you will test in the future, even if the backend is not LDAP-based. 

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-c2449a34-5867cb59.libcurl.so/. 

 Steps: 
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-c2449a34-5867cb59.libcurl.so/. 
    2) We can see login page. Let's fill own credentials username: admin, password: password or whatever you want. 
         Also be sure burpsuit should run in this process. 
   3) Let's go to the HTTP history and we can see post method send that request to repeater. 
   4) Remove the row of username and password. ALso send the request. Now you can see the key in response.
   5)  Congratulations! The key for this exercise is f99300bf-9434-4dad-b0b2-ef3ae68b61a5.

         Happy Hacking!! :)
