  Authorization 06

In this exercise, you can register an account. However, you won't be part of an organisation. The goal is to join the organisation Organisation #1

To do so you will need to set your organisation using mass-assignment.

By convention (can be changed programmatically) when a developer uses ActiveRecord (Ruby-on-Rails' most common data mapper), and a class Organisation has multiple User, the relation is managed using a field organisation_id inside the User class:

The following code is used in Ruby:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :organisation
end

class Organisation < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :users
end

You can guess the fact that organisation is used by visiting the organisation page and looking at the URL. 
You will see that the class is probably named Organisation. And therefore the key in the users table is likely to be organisation_id.

* Ruby-on-Rails enforces "convention" over "configuration" which really helps to guess class names and attributes' name... 
Using this information, you should be able to set your current organisation to get access to the "key".

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-a3309074-01b4cbcd.libcurl.so/. 

 Steps: 
 1) Visit the given link: http://ptc-a3309074-01b4cbcd.libcurl.so/. 
 2) Register with username 'user2' and password 'password'. Also intercept the process in burpsuite. 
     The objective of this exercise is to find a way to get access to the organisation #1
 3) Copy the password parameter. 
   Seems: user%5Busername%5D=user2&user%5Bpassword%5D=password&submit=Submit&user2&user%5Bpassword%5D=password
 4) Put the organisation id and change the parameter=password to parameter=1 at the end.
     It seems: user%5Busername%5D=user2&user%5Bpassword%5D=password&submit=Submit&user%5Borganisation_id%5D=1
 5) Boom!! You are part of the organisation #1. Congratulations, you solved this challenge, the key is: cc84d6f2-0ba6-4240-91b9-fbe15bb23d77

Happy Hacking!! :)
