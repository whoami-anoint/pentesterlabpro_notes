Authorization 02 

In this example, you can access the information using a method similar to the one seen previously. 
You cannot just directly access the information, however you can see that you are now able to edit information, and you can use this feature to access information from other users just by incrementing the number in the URL.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-1995f461-6f7c18eb.libcurl.so/. 

  In this exercise, you can log in with the following user: user1 with the password "pentesterlab".
   Once you logged in and have a play around, try to access the information from user2. 

   Steps: 
   1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-1995f461-6f7c18eb.libcurl.so/. 
   2) Log in with the following user: user1 with the password "pentesterlab". 
   3) You can try infos/1 and infos/2 but this time infos/3 don't work. Maybe the connection just out. So,we get logged out. 
   4) Let's edit infos/1 the Confidential user1 (Edit this info). And now change the parameter infos/1/edit to infos/3/edit. 
   5) Boom!! Now we get the Confidential user2. The KEY is 5e6bc836-1a96-41a8-90df-398efa6cb9d1.

   Happy Hacking !! :)
