Authorization 03

In this example, you can see an example of a classic mistake with modern frameworks. Here most of the code is generated automatically and access to different formats (HTML, JSON) for the same database record is also done automatically.

For example, by accessing /users/1, you will see an HTML page with the first user's details. However the scoring key has been masked.

Fortunately, you should be able to access the JSON representation of this user's details by modifying the URL.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-02742bbc-19af4783.libcurl.so/. 

 Steps: 
 1) Visit the given url: http://ptc-02742bbc-19af4783.libcurl.so/. And we get the admin user page open. 
 This exercise covers the exploitation of a vulnerability in the authorisation of a rails application.
 2) We can see Email : admin@libcurl.so and right side click the show button. But the keys are hidden. We can see the url: http://ptc-02742bbc-19af4783.libcurl.so/users/1.
 3) Try http://ptc-02742bbc-19af4783.libcurl.so/users/1.js but it don't works, key are still hidden. 
 4) Try  http://ptc-02742bbc-19af4783.libcurl.so/users/1.json. Finally we get the keys: "2c4258e1-f383-4f1d-b344-3305e1ad4a6d".

Concept about JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.

Happy Hacking!! :)
