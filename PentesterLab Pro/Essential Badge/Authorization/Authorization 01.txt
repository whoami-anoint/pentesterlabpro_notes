Authorization 01

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-47f94a40-0c9e0d16.libcurl.so/. 

 
In this example, you can log in with the following user: user1 with the password pentesterlab.
 Once you are logged in, you can start accessing information and see the pattern used: /infos/1, /infos/2. 
 If you keep incrementing the number in the URL, you can access information from the other users.

  (In this exercise, you can log in with the following user: user1 with the password "pentesterlab". 
  Once you logged in and have a play around, try to access the information from user2.)

 Steps: 

1) Visit the given url: http://ptc-47f94a40-0c9e0d16.libcurl.so/.
2) Login with the User: User1 and Password: pentesterlab.
3) We can see infos/1 and infos/2. 
4) Try to iterating to see if there are other infos. And if you go to infos/3, we can see that Confidential user2. The KEY is 57af609c-9204-4a4f-aaac-058f169ea913s

Key points: It often works not just only infos/2, infosec/3 but just keep going from infos/2 to infos/100 and if you have different result.

Happy Hacking!! :)
