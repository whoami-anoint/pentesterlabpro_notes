SQL Injection

In the previous challenge, we saw that SQL string can use single quote or double quote.
 Let's adapt our payload from the previous challenge to work with this one.

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-1ac596b3-ad1116c5.libcurl.so/. 
  You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: https://ptl-1ac596b3-ad1116c5.libcurl.so/.

Steps:
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-1ac596b3-ad1116c5.libcurl.so/. And we'll get login page.
    2) Let's fill the our credentials as: username:admin and password:admin.
        That's invalid. We can inject with single quote (') in admin side but we can notice you don't get any syntax error.
        Okay well, we can also inject with double quote (") if single one don't works.
        See it works now. While we put username: admin", have an error in your SQL syntax; 
        check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '"admin"" and password=md5("")' at line 1
        Now we can be sure, we can inject with sql injection.
    3) Notice that: '"admin"" and password=md5("")'
    4) We can inject with sql injection payload as we do in sql injecting 01.
        It shows as:                
                ---> admin" or 1=1 --"
    5) Put the final payload on your username and submit without password.
    6) Bravo!!  You are currently logged in! The key for this exercise is a5121ece-637e-42ba-85b8-6d2cca066b95.

        Happy Hacking!! :)
