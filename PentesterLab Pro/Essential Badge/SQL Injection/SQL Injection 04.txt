SQL Injection

In this example, the error message gives away the protection created by the developer: NO SPACE. 
This error message appears as soon as a space is injected inside the request. It prevents us from using the ' or '1'='1 method, or any fingerprinting that uses the space character. 
However, this filtering is easily bypassed, using tabulation (HT or \t). 
You will need to use encoding, to use it inside the HTTP request.
Using this simple bypass, you should be able to see how to detect this vulnerability.

 You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-a548d0d0-adf4029c.libcurl.so/. 
 You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: https://ptl-a548d0d0-adf4029c.libcurl.so/. 

    Steps: 
        1) Visit the given URL: http://ptl-a548d0d0-adf4029c.libcurl.so/. And we'll get login page.
        2) And we'll get login page. Let's fill our credentials as: username:admin and password:admin.
            But we aren't getting our access yet. That's invalid and try to put username:admin'.
            Then we have an error in your SQL syntax;
        3) Let's inject with our sql injection payload:
                a) admin' or '1'='1
                b) admin' or 1=1 --'
            We can use any of them. Let's use first one or either 2nd one too but the process is simple and same.
        4) For that we are using this payload to inject: admin' or '1'='1
            First of make the 'intercept on' in burpsuite for this procedure. Fill the username as: admin' or '1'='1 , and password as: admin
            Let's go to the burpsuite and we can see: 
            username=admin%27+or+%271%27%3D%271&password=admin
            Again we have to use '%09' instead of '+'.
            See how it looks : username=admin%27%09or%09%271%27%3D%271&password=admin
        5) Forward this request to the browser. And go back to the page.
        6) Bravo!! We are currently logged in! The key for this exercise is f79ebbbf-fce9-4861-b255-675decd468a3.

        Happy Hacking!! :)
