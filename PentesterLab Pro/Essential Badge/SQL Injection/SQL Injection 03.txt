SQL Injection 03

In this exercise, the developer checked that only one result is return by the database.
 You should be able to bypass this check by using the keyword LIMIT.

  You can access this exercise using the following URL: http://ptc-e39356da-572d0dbf.libcurl.so/.
   You can also use the TLS version if you're experiencing timeouts due to network filtering: https://ptl-e39356da-572d0dbf.libcurl.so/.
   
   Steps:
    1) Visit the given URL: http://ptc-e39356da-572d0dbf.libcurl.so/. And we'll get the login page.
    2) Simply we can inject with these sql injection commands:
        a) admin' or '1'='1
        b) admin' or 1=1 --'
        P.S: It differs in limits. If we get the limits number we can simply use:
                  admin' or 1=1 LIMIT 1 --
         Blah!blah!blah!blah!blah!blah! (I even don't get it properly. Lol, I use payload a and b while injecting the login page.)

     3) Bravo!! we are currently logged in! The key for this exercise is fe77e8d4-1d09-4066-b513-6e44c28916b8. 

        Happy Hacking!! :)
